After about a month of work and many, many hours of testing and revision, I'm finally ready to release a BDO companion app I've been developing. I call it LSC (short for “Life Skill Calculator”), and I hope you’ll all find it useful in your money making endeavors! But before I explain my creation, a disclaimer...

--This is a beta. Use with caution, and please report any problems you encounter!--

I’m also a programming novice, and this is the first bit of software I’ve finished/released. I barely know what I’m doing, it’s messy, there are missing/broken tooltips, and there are features that I haven’t implemented yet. There are definitely bugs, inconsistencies, performance issues, and so on. So, I always recommend double-checking the math, and checking recipes on BDO Codex or the like before acting on any information provided by LSC.

--So, what is LSC?--

In short, it's a life skill profitability calculator, not too unlike what you see on certain websites out there. Essentially, it helps calculate what an item costs to produce, and what your profit will be for selling it. However, LSC has two key features that set it apart:

First, LSC is a standalone app for Windows Desktop. It does not require an internet connection, nor does it require an iOS or Android device.

Second, LSC comes with a human-readable/editable item database in the form of a CSV (a form of spreadsheet, for the layman). This database not only stores information on items and their crafting recipes, but also stores market values. This allows the calculator to determine profitable crafts, with little to no effort or user-input.

Unfortunately, just telling you all this doesn't help much, and severely underplays how powerful the tool is – it's definitely something that needs to be used to be understood. So, give it a whirl, or at least take a look at the user guide! :)

I’ve also set up a Discord server for help, suggestions, and bug reporting: https://discord.gg/KMWHaGC

Also, since there will definitely be questions about this: LSC is not a hack, cheat, or anything of the like. It does not interact with the BDO client in any way. The likelyhood of it getting you banned is the same as if you were using a wiki. In code terms, the only “external” functionality it has is reading/writing the database file and a user settings binary file, and launching URLs – that's it.

--Donate--

Because I like to eat. Eating is good. And this took hundreds of hours to make. Seriously though, don't feel obligated. There are no ads, and nothing will ever be pay-walled.

Eventually I’ll set up a Paypal link, but it's being finicky…

Last but certainly not least, a special thanks to my testers, Eddit and Ryalin of Espers. You two made an incredible difference in the overall quality and development speed of LSC. Thank you :)
