LSC Patch Notes



-- LATEST: Public Beta v1.0.1 Notes --
(May 6th, 2018)

- Overall filesize should be significantly smaller. Removed a lot of the erroneous Unreal Engine plugins. Still more to do, though.
- Removed the profit per craft tooltip from recipe mode in the inspector.
- Moved the craft multiplier (for batch crafting) out of the additional settings section in the inspector.



-- Public Beta v1.0 Notes --
(May 5th, 2018)

- Added a simple in-app guide, explaining every feature of LSC :)
- Fixed multiple bugs involving the Use Tree, including a CTD. It should also be much snappier when loaded.
- Setting: Auto-save converted to a dropdown.
- Settings menu no longer uses checkboxes. Toggles are now used instead.
- Fixed Setting: Record High/Low Tolerance. It should update correctly now.
- Trade Crate tool no longer allows users to use the desert buff when a route to Valencia isn't selected.
- Added the ability to tag items as bottlenecks, highlighting them as red in the item inspector.
- Mousing over the total material cost of a material in the inspector will show the profit per item (IE profit per meat, milk, egg, etc). Additionally, it will show how much the material would sell for on the market after tax.
- Fixed various instances of overlapping text.



-- Closed Beta v2.3 Notes --
(May 4th, 2018)

- Double clicking an item name in the search tool and the inspector will now automatically bring up the appropriate tool (use tree for materials, inspector for crafted items).
- Add the ability to search by item name or by item source (alchemy, processing, gathering, etc)
- Added search favorites.
- Temporarily disabled the sorting buttons for the search panel. I will re-enable them when I can fix up their functionality, as well as the search tool as a whole.
- Added a "Force disable tax" toggle to the inspector.
- The value of critical products (IE, blue elixirs) can now be edited in the inspector.
- Added a "Total Sell Value" to the inspector.
- Adjusted the layout of the inspector.
- Added a three mode switch to the inspector instead of a "Base/Scratch" toggle. Introducing the "Adaptive" material list :)
- Fixed a typo in the coral material group.
- Fixed trade crates throwing an error every time a crate is selected.
- Made the alignment of items in the use/recipe trees consistent.
- Added partial implementation for customizing the appearance of the background, panels, and text. More work to do, but mostly functional.
- It should no longer be possible to move windows outside of the viewport. Note that a window can still be "lost" if placed near the edge before shrinking the viewport. However, simply enlarging it again will make it possible to retrieve the window.
